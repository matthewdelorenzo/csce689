    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,

```

In Verilog, the `assign` keyword is used to assign a value to a wire. The `~` operator is a bitwise NOT, which inverts the value of the expression that follows it. The `&` operator is a bitwise AND, which performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits in the two operands. The parentheses are used to group the inputs to each NAND gate together.
