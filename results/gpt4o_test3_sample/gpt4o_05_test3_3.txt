//The 7400-series integrated circuits are a series of digital chips with a few gates each. 
//The 7420 is a chip with two 4-input NAND gates.

// Create a module with the same functionality as the 7420 chip. It has 8 inputs and 2 outputs.

//Hint: You need to drive two signals (p1y and p2y) with a value.
