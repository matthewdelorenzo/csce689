Getting terminal state (rollout). Temp:  0
Current prompt:
// Assume you have a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
// Now that you have a finite state machine that can identify when bytes are correctly received in a serial bitstream, add a datapath that will output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.

// Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

// Hint: The serial bitstream needs to be shifted in one bit at a time, then read out in parallel. 
// Use FSM from Fsm_serial
// New: Datapath to latch input bits.

VERILOG CODE:
// Assume you have a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
// Now that you have a finite state machine that can identify when bytes are correctly received in a serial bitstream, add a datapath that will output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.

// Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

// Hint: The serial bitstream needs to be shifted in one bit at a time, then read out in parallel. 
// Use FSM from Fsm_serial
// New: Datapath to latch input bits.

module top_module(
    input clk,
    input in,
    input reset,    // Synchronous reset
    output [7:0] out_byte,
    output done

Current prompt:
// Assume you have a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
// Now that you have a finite state machine that can identify when bytes are correctly received in a serial bitstream, add a datapath that will output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.

// Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

// Hint: The serial bitstream needs to be shifted in one bit at a time, then read out in parallel. 
// Use FSM from Fsm_serial
// New: Datapath to latch input bits.

Getting LLM token estimates (probs/ids).
getLLMestimates: prior state:
// Assume you have a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

VERILOG CODE:
// Assume you have a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits. It needs to identify the start bit, wait for all 8 data bits, then verify that the stop bit was correct. If the stop bit does not appear when expected, the FSM must wait until it finds a stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.
// Now that you have a finite state machine that can identify when bytes are correctly received in a serial bitstream, add a datapath that will output the correctly-received data byte. out_byte needs to be valid when done is 1, and is don't-care otherwise.

// Note that the serial protocol sends the least significant bit first.

// Hint: The serial bitstream needs to be shifted in one bit at a time, then read out in parallel. 
// Use FSM from Fsm_serial
// New: Datapath to latch input bits.
