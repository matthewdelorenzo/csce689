        Implement a 64 bit multiplier with a 128 bit output.
        This is a combinational circuit with a single input and output.
        The input is a 64 bit binary number.
        The output is a 128 bit binary number.
        The output is the product of the input and the input.
        For example, if the input is 32'b10001000100010001000100010001000 then the output is
